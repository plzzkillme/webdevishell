	<h2>Some people simply deserve to die</h2>
	<P>Do not dare to complain if you are financially able to study abroad. Stop trying to ingratiate with other people, <b>they do not give a shit about you.</b> Those who attach to others to fill their own insecurities are <em>selfish cunts</em>. <strong>You do not matter to them</strong>, mind your own business</P>
	<p>It is important to consider the <u>consequences</u> of actions before doing it, yet it is easy to see those that do not follow this rule and what kind of person they are. <i>Fucking delusional.</i></p>

	<h2>Good people actually make an impact, they put in effort and time to building the world without expecting anything in return because they genuinely care</h2>
	<h3>All that effort is disrespected by the idiots who come in with shallow intentions</h3>
	<h3>They are ignorant for the history, struggles, energy that was invested</h3>
