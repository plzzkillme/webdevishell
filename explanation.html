	<h2>Good people actually make an impact, they put in effort and time to building the world without expecting anything in return because they genuinely care</h2>
<!-- If you are a dev and seeing this, below is the explanation for the reasons people who disobey the rules of life must go to hell -->
	<h3>All that effort is disrespected by the idiots who come in with shallow intentions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>They ruin the world that is built through hard work</li>
		<li>interfere with their atrocious attitudes</li>
		<li>have a disgusting amount of privelege</li>
		<li>lack basic awareness</li>
		<li>acting entitled to time and attention</li>
		<li>find opportunities to fuck things over</li>
		<li>push everything aside like a rat</li>
		<li>think anything that is not related to themselves do not matter</li>
		<li>have no idea how their actions affect the world</li>
		<li>are clueless, slefish, disrespectful</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>They are ignorant for the history, struggles, energy that was invested</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>unfortunately these motherfuckers have shared environments</li>
		<li>they start doing stupid shit. <br>sometimes going extreme length of deliberately planning the whole damn thing</li>
		<li>some kind of fucking black magic happens. <br>suddenly everyone is being brainwashed by them</li>
		<li>their egos start going through the roof</li>
		<li>the world starts to crumble by their shitty influence</li>
		<li>whatever good remaining watch and cannot do anything about it</li>
		<li>the aftermath is a shitty world with shitty people</li>
		<li>those dickheads leave the problems they cause up to the civil ones to deal with</li>
